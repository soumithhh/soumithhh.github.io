Hello and welcome to Soumith's Shelf! My name is Soumith, and I'm an Electrical Engineer with a passion for learning and exploring new technologies (Just kidding!!). When I'm not working on engineering projects, you can find me buried in a good book. I'm also the founder of the [Papataka Book Club](https://www.instagram.com/papatakabookclub/), where I love to engage in thoughtful discussions with fellow book enthusiasts (mostly my friends).

As an engineer and a lifelong learner (my parents think this), I'm constantly curious about the world around me and always looking to expand my knowledge (basically to stay away from trouble). I love exploring different technologies and discovering new ways to apply them to solve problems (Problems solved so far 0!).

Through this blog, I aim to share my experiences, insights, and discoveries with my readers (in another words, to myself!). I hope to inspire and educate others who share my love for learning, exploring, and making meaningful connections. (ChatGPT is having high expectations on me)

Thank you for stopping by, and I can't wait to connect with you! (have to say this, an attempt to get disappointment)
