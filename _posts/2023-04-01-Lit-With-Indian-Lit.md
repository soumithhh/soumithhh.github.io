Readthon Hosted By Smriti.
<!-- excerpt -->



Smriti hosts an annual Readathon called "Lit with Indian Lit," which features engaging prompts to inspire readers to explore translated Indian literature. This year, I have chosen three books to fulfill the prompts: 
1. "My Story" by Kamala Das for a book I've been putting off, 
2. "The Black Hill" by Mamang Dai for an award-winning/nominated book, and 
3. "Lajja: Shame" by Taslima Nasrin, translated by Tutul Gupta, for a book translated from a language I've rarely or never read before. 


I am committed to updating my progress regularly, so be sure to check out this blog.
