Book Review

<!-- excerpt -->

Lajja by Taslima Nasreen is a thought-provoking novel that highlights the struggles of a minority family living in Bangladesh. The story is set after the Babri Masjid incident in India, which triggers a series of unfortunate events in Bangladesh leading to the persecution of minorities. As I read this book, I found myself questioning the safety of minorities in my own country and how the internal problems of a country can have a significant impact on the citizens of another country. Lajja is a powerful and important book that raises critical questions about communal violence and its impact on minority communities. It is a must-read for anyone interested in South Asian politics, religion, and social issues.

I read Lajja as part of the Lit with Indian Lit readathon hosted by Smriti.
